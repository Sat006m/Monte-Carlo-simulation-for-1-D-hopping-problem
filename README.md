# Monte-Carlo-simulation-for-1-D-hopping-problem
Here in this Project we are considering a disordered semiconductor whose energy sites are present in !-D.
These sites energy here is calculated by using gaussian random number.
while the probability of electron hopping after starting at middle of 2000 site is calculated by using uniform random number
and the time required for hopping from one site to another site is calculated by using exponential random number.I have mentioned the steps in the code.
